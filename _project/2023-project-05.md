This study aims to explore an emotion-driven memory retrieval system, designed for use by intelligent agents with advanced text comprehension and generation capabilities. The essence of an intelligent agent lies in its large language model (LLM), which can convert environmental perceptions into textual information and address the majority of encountered issues. However, an excellent memory retrieval system is indispensable for more efficient behavioral performance. In daily life, emotional fluctuations significantly impact our memory system. When an individual experiences intense emotional reactions to an event, it often leaves a profound imprint on their memory. Based on this, we propose an emotion-driven memory retrieval system, integrating an affective computing module, enabling the LLM to perceive and retrieve memories based on the current emotional state. This system is founded on five core dimensions: Memory Importance Score, Memory Time Score, Citation Score, Sentiment Score, and Relevance Score. These dimensions interact with each other to determine the efficiency of memory retrieval. By weighted summation of these five dimensions, the system effectively retrieves and ranks memories that best meet current needs. Overall, this research not only provides a new perspective on understanding how emotions affect memory retrieval but also offers a practical methodology for enhancing the memory retrieval efficiency of intelligent agents in complex emotional environments.
