Image captioning is a classic research direction in the multimodal field, but often suffers from limitations like low computational efficiency, redundant visual information, and over-reliance on image processing. This work proposes a novel end-to-end model called SCAP, which aims to address these weaknesses by introducing unique modal feature compression and forgetting mechanisms in the encoder. These mechanisms can distill the visual information, remove noise, and retain only the essential information, thereby improving the mapping from pixel space to semantic space. The refined features are directly input into a hierarchical decoder to generate the predictions.
