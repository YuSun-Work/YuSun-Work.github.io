Multimodal robots that can respond through visual and textual information - we treat the robot as an intelligent agent that follows spoken or textual commands to perform responsive behaviors. Our primary focus is enabling robots to identify and grasp target objects based on linguistic directives. Additionally, we incorporated reinforcement learning so that the robot can execute similar tasks faster in a consistent environment. This allows the robot to refine its visual and motor skills through experience as it repeatedly performs object manipulation in the same setting. By utilizing algorithms such as lightweight target detection and reinforcement learning, our system allows humans and robots to collaborate more naturally and effectively on object retrieval tasks guided by verbal human commands.
