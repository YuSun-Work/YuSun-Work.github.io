We propose a specialized legal large-scale model that is unique in that it is web-indexed and capable of retrieving and integrating up-to-date legal information. The model incorporates real-time web indexing techniques and a specially designed large-scale language model (LLM) that enables coarse and fine-grained retrieval of legal information, which is further refined and analyzed by the LLM. The core strength of the model is its ability to access the latest legal research and data through dynamic web searches, ensuring that the information provided is current and relevant. This legal field-focused model outperforms existing LLM and web indexing systems in several ways. Not only does it provide more accurate and relevant information, but it also reflects the latest changes in legal practice and research findings in a timely manner, thus greatly increasing its value in legal information retrieval and decision support. This is particularly important for legal professionals who rely on the most up-to-date and accurate information to make critical decisions.
