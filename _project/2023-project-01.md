Modern medical practice requires timely, accurate information, but even advanced large language models (LLMs) face challenges providing outdated advice without up-to-date support. This study develops a specialized medical mega-model with web-indexing capabilities to retrieve and integrate real-time medical information, enhancing accuracy and reliability. We designed an advanced hybrid architecture combining real-time web indexing and a specialized LLM. The model performs coarse then fine-grained web retrieval, followed by refinements from the medical LLM. By integrating dynamic web search, it accesses the latest research and data. This medically focused model demonstrated higher accuracy and relevance than conventional LLMs and web indexing systems. It reflects the latest clinical practice changes and research discoveries. Our specialized medical mega-models with web-indexing are powerful tools for information retrieval and clinical decision support, providing up-to-date, relevant, accurate information critical for real-time medical needs. Future research will explore integration into medical systems and evaluate impacts.
