This innovative work introduces a specialized medical mega-model that combines the functionalities of an Image Caption model and a unimodal large language model (LLM), achieving the capabilities of a multimodal large model. This approach addresses the challenge of limited multimodal data during model fine-tuning, a problem not faced by unimodal models with their extensive network datasets. The Image Caption model was specifically trained on clinical image data, sourced from multiple hospitals and professionally labeled. In contrast, the unimodal model was trained and fine-tuned using real clinical questions and answers from the web, supplemented with integrated treatment plans and suggestions from each hospital. This unique combination allows the model to provide timely, accurate medical information, leveraging real-time web indexing for enhanced accuracy and reliability. It performs both coarse and fine-grained web retrieval, complemented by the medical LLM's refinements. By accessing the latest research and clinical data through dynamic web search, this model demonstrates higher accuracy and relevance compared to traditional LLMs and web indexing systems. It effectively reflects the latest changes in clinical practice and research discoveries. As a result, this medical mega-model with web-indexing capabilities emerges as a powerful tool for information retrieval and clinical decision support, meeting the critical real-time medical needs. Future research will focus on integrating this model into medical systems and evaluating its impact.
