Generative recommendation systems allow us to generate personalized outfit recommendations based on historical purchase records or input fashion style images. The model learns to generate new clothing items tailored to the user's visual style preferences. Additionally, we design instruction inputs to refine the generated outfits by adjusting attributes like color, pattern, or shape. This conditional generation approach produces novel and customized fashion recommendations. Compared to retrieving items from a fixed catalog, our system can expand the recommendation space by synthesizing completely new clothing that matches an individual's taste. The controllable generation process also allows users to guide the model to create styles they want but may not exist yet. By leveraging generative modeling and instruction tuning, our system aims to provide more diverse and creative fashion recommendations optimized for personal needs.
