In multimodal recommendation systems, high-quality data is crucial for model performance. We need not only high-quality image data, but also rich, matching textual data. To enhance the text data, we use large language models for data augmentation. Meanwhile, large language models also improve the explainability of recommendation systems remarkably. They can generate coherent recommendation explanations according to the recommended items.
