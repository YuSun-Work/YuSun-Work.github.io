This work proposes a framework for 3D reconstruction of incomplete masked images, with an application to restoration and 3D modeling of damaged cultural relics. The pipeline consists of: <br>
1) random masking of cultural relic images;<br>
2) recovering the masked images using a masked autoencoder;<br>
3) sharpening the blurry recovered mask regions with super-resolution methods based on GANs and diffusion models;<br>
4) 3D reconstruction from the sharpened completed images to generate 3D models.<br>
This allows generating 3D models from extremely damaged 2D images with missing regions, which can assist in restoration and digitization of cultural heritage.
